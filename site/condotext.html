<p>CONDOMAXIUM is a real condo showroom about a fictional condo called CONDOMAXIUM. It features images of the interior of the condo and 3D models of the exterior of the condo. It also functions as an installation where a variety of performances take place. We sing songs and read scripts about condos and condo showrooms. We give Ted Talkz about trendy urban lifestyle. We provide literature about our condo and allow showroom visitors the unique opportunity to sign up for a special spot in our condo, CONDOMAXIUM.</p>
