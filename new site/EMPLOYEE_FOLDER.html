Though Stan had long been considered the most intern of all interns because of his intern immortality, Phil changed this by obtaining the job of Stan’s intern.

Ivan Phone, Senior Founder of TGM Enterprises has a poster for each of these concepts hanging in his office. He stares at them day in and night in, hoping to absorb them as skills. van, the Senior founder of TGM Enterprises, sometimes feels threatened by the talent around them. He wants everyone to know that he is the big boss in the big chair, but his leadership skills and public speaking ability is lacking, especially when compared with his fellow executives. He often schedules Leadership Seminars, but doesn’t tell anyone about them so he can attend them privately to gain a competitive edge (and also he secretly is sexually aroused by workshop leaders). There are lots of scenes involving Ivan alone with a professional speaker, alone together in a conference room, with Ivan grilling the speaker for advice and eventually having an emotional alcohol induced meltdown. He has an elaborate toy dragon collection space in his office.

Joan burns the corporate candle from both ends. Joan is calm, cool, controlling. When he is not networking and presenting, he is usually recharging in a large chair, staring directly ahead and just… thinking. Joan is everyone’s best friend, a cutthroat business man with an ear, eye and nose for money. Joan sometimes stares into space for long periods of time with no explanation. Joan lives in fear of someone digging up his “dirty little secrets”, what these secrets are, no one knows for certain, not even Joan.<br>

          <img  src="assets/img/people/cathy.png"><p class="people_info">When the Beige Wars were about to end in the catastrophic destruction of Tough Guy Mountain as we know it, interns were working around the clock running different simulations of how TGM could come out on top. “Computers combined with Interns is a no-fail solution.” This was a quote by Ivan Phone shortly after the war was won. The computers (and their interns) came up with a brilliant idea that was swiftly acted upon by the higher-ups. Leaving a trail of beige clothing items designed to catch the interest of the Beige Princess Beige Cathy, the Execs lured her back to the HQ, kidnapping her and naming her their ward. This led to immediate surrender and effectively transformed the Beige Kingdom from TGM’s deadly foe, into just another company asset. Beige Cathy is rather non-plussed and unaffected by all this and is kept distracted from her imprisonment well enough by simple secretarial tasks.<br>
          Beige Cathy is played by Cat Bluemke, a featured flat-media/performance artist and project manager at Tough Guy Mountain.</p>

She is TGM’s first “Brand Ambassador”, using her own brand to enhance that of the Mountain’s.

He has a high powered job, a great condo with great amenities and all the material possessions and great brands one could desire. All of his friends and families are robots that he can turn on and off, and Kyle makes sure to have different sets of customizable yuppie family archetype sets, just to mix things up. When he comes into the office, it is mostly to play very silly pranks on the interns, or try to convince them it’s their job to come clean his hot tub.<br>
